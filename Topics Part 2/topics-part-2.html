            A Curated Compilation on Adulting & Living in Experiences
<br><br>
            Imagine you’re a grown-up,
and being a grown-up means you have
to do lots of important stuff like going
to work, taking care of your home, and
being nice to people. That’s called
“adulting.”
But you know
what? Grown-ups also need to
have fun and enjoy special moments,
like playing with your toys, going to the
park, or having ice cream. That's how they return to themselves.
That’s called being “present” or being right there in the
fun moment.
</p><p>
Sometimes, being a grown-up and
having fun moments can be like a
seesaw. You have to balance them. If
you only do grown-up stuff all the time,
it’s not so much fun. And if you
only have fun all the time,
you might forget
important grown-up things.
So, being a good grown-up means
finding the right balance. You do your
grown-up things, but you also make sure
to have lots of fun moments and enjoy
them like a big kid. That way, Jack won't be a dull boy!
